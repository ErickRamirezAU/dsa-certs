# DataStax Academy Certificate Lookup POC
In July 2020, the [**DataStax Academy**](https://academy.datastax.com) site migrated to a new learning management system (LMS). The LMS however is not capable of hosting the certificates of the DBAs and developers who have successfully passed the Apache Cassandraâ„¢ 3 exam.

This app is a proof-of-concept attempt at providing a mechanism for certified users to be able to download a copy of their certificates.
